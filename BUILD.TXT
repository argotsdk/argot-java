Argot Java
----------

This is the Java version of the Argot runtime library.



Requirements
------------

The Argot library itself has no dependencies on external libraries
other than those supplied with Java itself.

To build and run the test cases you require junit. Junit is available
at http://www.junit.org/.  It is also available in the eclipse IDE.

If you wish to build the runtime library from the commandline you
will require ANT.  ANT is available at http://ant.apache.org/



Building Argot Java
-------------------

To build the Java version of Argot, we have a simple ANT script.
This will compile and create a distribution zip file which contains
the jar file.

The ANT script is still simple.  We expect to add automated Junit
testing in the future.
