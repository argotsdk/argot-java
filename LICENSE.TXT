4. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY

	To the fullest extent permitted by the laws of the applicable jurisdiction,
	the Software is provided under this License on an “as is” basis, without
	warranty of any kind, either expressed or implied, including, without
	limitation, warranties that the Software is free of defects, merchantable,

	their nature, must remain in effect beyond the termination of this License 
	shall survive.

	the Developer will terminate automatically at the expiration of such 60 day
	notice period, unless if within such 60 day period You withdraw Your claim

6. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY

	To the fullest extent permitted by law, under no circumstances and under

	otherwise, shall You, the Developer, or any distributor of the software, 
	or any supplier of any of such parties, be liable to any person for any 
	indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages of any character 
	including, without limitation, damages for lost profits, loss of 
	goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all 
	other commercial damages or losses, even if such party shall have been 
	informed of the possibility of such damages. This limitation of liability 
	shall not apply to liability for death or personal injury resulting from 
	such party’s negligence to the extent applicable law prohibits such 
	limitation. Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of 
	incidental or consequential damages, so this exclusion and limitation may 
	not apply to You.
	
7. MISCELLANEOUS

	This License represents the complete agreement concerning rights to use 
	and distribute the Software. If any provision of this License is held to 
	be unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent

	law of the jurisdiction specified in a notice contained within the 
	Software (except to the extent applicable law, if any, provides 
	otherwise), excluding such jurisdiction’s conflict-of-law provisions. 
	Any litigation relating to this License shall be subject to the 
	jurisdiction of the courts located in the jurisdiction and venue 
	specified in a notice contained within the Software, with the losing 
	party responsible for costs, including, without limitation, court costs 
	and reasonable attorneys’ fees and expenses. The application of the 
	United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods
	is expressly excluded. Any law or regulation, which provides that the 
	language of a contract shall be construed against the drafter shall not 
	apply to this License. You agree that You alone are responsible for 
	compliance with the United States export administration regulations (and 
	the export control laws and regulation of any other countries) when You 
	use, distribute or otherwise make available any Software.
