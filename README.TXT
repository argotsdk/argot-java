Argot
-----

The Argot library provides a programming language neutral method of 
describing, reading and writing information in a binary format.  Argot 
is currently available for Java, C and .Net(C#), allowing for easy 
data integration between hetrogenous systems.

Argot provides binary meta data able to describe, read and write any 
well structured binary data.  Argot's ability to work directly with 
binary data makes it an ideal solution where bandwidth and computing 
power need to be conserved. With a unique dictionary and data mapping 
system, it can be used to build flexible heterogenous distributed 
systems. It is a perfect alternative to XML where speed, data size, 
and data integrity are required.

Please read the Argot Programmer's Guide available in the doc
directory of the distribution.


Argot Compiler
--------------

The Argot Compiler is required to create Argot dictionary files.  
The ac.bat file in the bin directory requires the ARGOT_HOME environment 
variable is defined and set to the base directory of the Argot 
installation.

The Argot Compiler is currently only available in Java. 

Please view the example .argot files to see how argot is specified.
