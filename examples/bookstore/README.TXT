This provides a small complete application that demonstrates Argot.

 
Argot is used to read and write the bookstore data file.  This
 example lays 
the ground work to the example provided with Colony. 

In the Colony example, 
the same code used to read and write the 
bookstore data file is used to 
communicate books between systems 
using Argot Network Resolution.
